## Project Proposal

### Data Set

Maternal Health Risk Data Set
Abstract: Data has been collected from different hospitals, community clinics, maternal health cares from the rural areas of Bangladesh through the IoT based risk monitoring system.

### Predictive and Inferential Research Questions

a. Main predictive question: 

  We want to use important maternal information including blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), blood glucose levels, heart rate, body temperature, and age to predict the risk level (low, medium, high) of the mother during pregnancy. 
  
b. Sub-questions: 

  Which attributes of maternal health are the most important in determining the maternal health risk level? (inferential) 

### Plan of Analyzing the Data

a. Our project is a classification problem. 

b. Model we will try: 

  i. k-NN
  
  ii. Other models to try later: 
  
    1. Decision trees 
    
    2. SVMs 
    
    3. Logistic regression for classification 

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Split the data set into train data set and test data set

a. Table: 

  Distribution of 6 attributes and target class in the train data set
  
b. EDA figure: 

  i. Distribution of all 7 attributes separated/colored by target class (density distribution?) 
  
  ii. Pairwise scatter plots for all the predictors

### Share the Results as Tables and Figures
The results will be shared in a Jupyter Notebook with tables and figures included and the results is reproducible.
